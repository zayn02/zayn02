Hi there, I am Mohammad Saddam Ali!ðŸ‘‹
I am an aspiring Front-End Developer seeking to make forays into the world of tech. I wish to work and contribute and leave a mark, no matter how small or big. Technology has come a long way in aiding our day-to-day life, and I too wish to be part of this adventure.

As I am at the beginning of my journey, I do not seek to discriminate on the projects that I could work on. I am willing to work on any project, be it open source or otherwise. I have been trained in App development, so there is a familiarity there, but unknown terrains won't hold me back.
